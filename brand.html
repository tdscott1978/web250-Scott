	<h1>The idea...</h1>
	
	<p>My wife, Kimberly, is into crafts. I got her a Cricut, a vinyl die-cutter for her birthday a few years back. She began by making shirts for the family.
	she expanded into making crafts such as custom glasses, candy dishes, and ornaments. She has since expanded to wood crafts, gift boxes, and shirts for events and companies.
	She started a business and called it Keep It Memorable. Kimberly uses Instagram for most of her business. 
	I wanted to make her a website that would make it easier to navigate and browse all the things that she can do.</p><br/>
	
	<h1>The Theme...</h1>
	
		<p>  Our twin sons are color coordinated, using the colors green and blue. Using those colors, I went with an ocean theme because the beach is our favorite place to go. 
		She already has a logo, but I will have to come up with something more creative for the banner. I the Allura and ShadowsIntoLightTwo fonts to give it a hand-written, personal feel.
		And I used the classic Helvetica for the body of the text.</p>
